# Casino Simulation with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive casino simulation implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It serves as the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming subject. The simulation aims to replicate the ambiance of a real casino and offers a diverse range of authentic casino games, including roulette, dice games, and more.

## Key Features

- **Advanced OOP Design:** The simulation is built upon an advanced OOP design that accurately models various casino elements, from games, players, and dealers to tables and chips. Each component is represented as an object with specific properties and behaviors.

- **Wide Variety of Casino Games:** Players can immerse themselves in a selection of genuine casino games, such as roulette and dice games, all faithfully recreating the rules and probabilities of real-world counterparts.

- **Realistic Player Interaction:** The simulation provides a lifelike player experience, allowing players to interact with games, place bets, make strategic decisions, and experience the thrill of winning or losing in real-time, creating an immersive and authentic gaming environment.

- **Comprehensive Resource Management:** In addition to the games, the simulation includes a resource management system, enabling players to manage chips, track winnings and losses, administer their bets, and apply gaming strategies to maximize their earnings.

- **Detailed Statistics and Accurate Results:** The simulation generates comprehensive statistics on game outcomes, offering a breakdown of winnings and losses per game and per player. Players can review their gaming history and evaluate their performance.

- **Visually Appealing User Interface:** A visually appealing user interface has been crafted to replicate the atmosphere and aesthetics of a real casino. Visual and auditory elements contribute to an authentic and immersive gaming experience.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into multiple directories, each corresponding to a practice completed during the Object-Oriented Programming subject.
